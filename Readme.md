# Flax Engine

It is a custom made game engine structured in C++. The main goal of this project is to provide a high-performance, 
flexible, and easy-to-develop engine for game developers who are experienced in both games and graphics. The engine 
is designed to be modular, allowing developers to easily extend its functionality.

Flax Engine, has no built-in rendering pipeline solution, it is designed to be used as sandbox for developers to create their own
rendering optimizations and rendering pipelines. There will be a couple of free-to-use rendering pipelines available as 
plugins, but the main goal is to provide visual framework.

There will be multiple of shipped examples, which will showcase the engine capabilities, but there won't be access to the source
of those pipelines, as they are meant to be used as a reference for developers to create their own pipelines. No need to worry about
it because the documentations below will help you to understand how to create your own rendering pipelines.
